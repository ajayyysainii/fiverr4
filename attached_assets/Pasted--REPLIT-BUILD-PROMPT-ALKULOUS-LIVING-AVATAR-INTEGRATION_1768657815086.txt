🔧 REPLIT BUILD PROMPT — ALKULOUS LIVING AVATAR INTEGRATION
📌 PROJECT CONTEXT
We have an existing Alkulous website UI that currently displays a static image/avatar of Alkulous.
We now have a front-facing looping video of Alkulous (head + face) that must replace the static image and act as a living AI interface.
The video already exists and will be provided.
🎯 OBJECTIVE
Replace the existing static Alkulous image with a looping video avatar that:
Appears idle (standing still, calm) when not speaking
Animates naturally while Alkulous is talking
Syncs mouth and eye movement to AI speech
Integrates cleanly with the existing Alkulous chat / voice system
Removes all legacy image-based avatar code
This must feel professional, alive, and enterprise-grade.
🧠 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1️⃣ Avatar Replacement
Remove the existing <img> or image-based Alkulous avatar
Replace it with an HTML <video> element
Video must be:
Front-facing
Centered
Responsive (desktop + mobile)
Loop-safe
2️⃣ Idle vs Talking States
Implement two visual states:
🟢 IDLE STATE
Video loops silently
Alkulous appears attentive and calm
No exaggerated motion
No audio
🔵 TALKING STATE
When Alkulous is responding:
Unmute or swap to speaking video
Mouth movement must align with speech
Eyes blink naturally
Subtle head movement allowed
When speech ends, return to idle loop
3️⃣ Voice + Video Sync
When AI audio playback starts:
Trigger “talking” state
When audio playback ends:
Return to idle loop
Do NOT restart the page
No visual flicker
Use JavaScript event listeners tied to:
Audio playback
AI response lifecycle
4️⃣ Technical Stack Expectations
Frontend: existing Alkulous UI (React / Vite / Next / plain JS — match current stack)
Video handling: native HTML5 video
State management: lightweight (no heavy animation libs unless required)
No third-party avatar services
5️⃣ File Structure (Example)
/public
  /video
    alkulous_idle.mp4
    alkulous_talking.mp4

/components
  AlkulousAvatar.tsx (or .jsx / .js)
6️⃣ Example Logic (Conceptual)
if (alkulousIsSpeaking) {
  showTalkingVideo()
} else {
  showIdleVideo()
}
Audio events should control the avatar state.
7️⃣ UX REQUIREMENTS
Smooth transitions
No lag between voice and mouth
Works offline if server is local
Must not block AI responses
8️⃣ REMOVE LEGACY CODE
Delete or disable:
Old image avatar
Any placeholder graphics
Any CSS tied to static avatar positioning
Replace references cleanly
9️⃣ FINAL RESULT
When complete:
Alkulous is no longer a picture
Alkulous appears alive
Users feel like they are talking to an intelligence, not a chatbot
The avatar becomes the primary interface, replacing traditional chat UI feel
🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE
Do NOT change the Alkulous avatar design
Do NOT stylize or redesign the face
Use the provided video exactly
No stock avatars
No cartoon effects
✅ DELIVERABLES
Updated Alkulous UI with video avatar
Clean, readable code
Existing functionality preserved
Old image fully removed
